## 👨‍💻 About Me

Completely passionate about knowledge, I maintain an uncontrollable desire to learn more and more about absolutely any subject. I love technological advancement and believe that ***the 'impossible' is just a limiting virus in the human mind***.

Instead of accepting that I can't achieve something, ***I prefer to ask: how can I achieve this?***

With this mindset, I believe humanity can overcome any limitation. Keep this in mind, after all, ***the mind is the only reality***.
